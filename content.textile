*Dear Senator,*

Great day! I'm writing to you about the recent issues about the _online libel_ provision of of the cybercrime law.

Senator, I fear for the future of our country. I think the _online libel_ provision can jeopardize our democracy. I want to live in a country where the citizens are free to praise the politicians, or point out their flaws, without fear of their words being taken against them.

Please, I urge you to support abolishing this provision from the law, for the sake of citizens like me and for our nation.

Yours truly,
_Rico Sta. Cruz_

h2(headline). Write some letters

The senator's offices have addresses you can write to. This can be more effective than an email.

To send mail, simply visit your nearest post office. You will need to buy a postage stamp (very cheap) to attach to your envelope.
