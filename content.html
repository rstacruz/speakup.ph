<p><strong>Dear Senator,</strong></p>
<p>Great day! I&#8217;m writing to you about the recent issues about the <em>online libel</em> provision of of the cybercrime law.</p>
<p>Senator, I fear for the future of our country. I think the <em>online libel</em> provision can jeopardize our democracy. I want to live in a country where the citizens are free to praise the politicians, or point out their flaws, without fear of their words being taken against them.</p>
<p>Please, I urge you to support abolishing this provision from the law, for the sake of citizens like me and for our nation.</p>
<p>Yours truly,<br />
<em>Rico Sta. Cruz</em></p>

<p>The senator&#8217;s offices have addresses you can write to. This can be more effective than an email.</p>
<p>To send mail, simply visit your nearest post office. You will need to buy a postage stamp (very cheap) to attach to your envelope.</p>
